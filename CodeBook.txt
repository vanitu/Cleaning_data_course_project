Tidy Data Set CodeBook
=================

Data represents prepared tidy data set prepared from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'CodeBook.txt'

- 'tidy_data/tidy_set.csv': Each row represents an observation window with labeled activity and subject. Each row includes mean and standard deviations for each measurement from a source dataset. 

- 'tidy_data/activity_subject_mean.csv': Each row represents measurement average value for each activity of each subject

- 'run_analysis.R': R-script file to prepare tidy datasets from a source data
